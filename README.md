# Apple Vision Clone
This project is a recreation of Apple's Vision website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Canvas, GSAP, and Locomotive Scroll. It aims to provide an immersive and visually stunning experience by integrating various cutting-edge technologies. The website includes all GSAP components like ScrollTrigger, Scrub, Pin, and Locomotive Scroll to ensure smooth animations and seamless scrolling. Images and videos were sourced from the original Apple website to maintain authenticity. Please note that while the website is not fully responsive, it is best viewed in desktop mode to appreciate the animations and interactions fully.

## Here is the demo
